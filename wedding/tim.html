    <h1>Wedding Speech for Tim and Fi</h1>
    <p>
      One of the hobs of the Best Man's Speech is to embarrass
      the Groom.  So I was trying to figure out what events in
      Tim's life were embracing.  Which of his past actions would
      cause him mortification if brought up in front of his
      friends and family?  To be honest &#8213; I was struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim's actions <i>would</i> cause embarrassment in others.
      Most would blush if it was mentioned that we lived in a
      flat that considerer mould as a pet.  We would move
      uncomfortably if our past associations with a rohoipnol
      dealer were brought to light in public.  If &#8213; during
      a reminiscence &#8213; it was revealed that you strained
      your ankle, while sitting down, you may feel more than a
      little awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, <i>none</i> of these actions seem to embarrass
      Tim.  Even if you remind him that he used yoga to improve
      his ballet moves that he used in netball, he will
      remain&#8230; unmoved.
    </p>
      <p>
        So Tim in remarkably immune to embarrassment.  He does
        not suffer from mortification because he is comfortable
        with life.  He is comfortable with his place in the great
        scheme of things.  He is comfortable with the direction
        that things are moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today you two move in a new direction: together into the
        future.  Your relationship cost me a flatmate, but it is
        a burden that is easy to bear because of your happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other job of the Best Man's Speech is an easy one.  I
        ask you to charge your classes and toast: Tim and Fi.
