    <h1>Wedding Speech for Mat and Jen</h1>
    <p>
      As the only other person here who regularly slept with Matt,
      I&#8230; Oh, sorry.
      As the only other person here who regularly slept
      <em>in the same room</em> as Matt, I was asked to say a few
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was walking down Bealey Ave in Christchurch the other day,
      thinking about what to say at this wedding, and I recalled when
      Matt told me he was going to propose to Jen.
      It was during that strange five-day period between Boxing Day
      and New Years Day, and Matt and I had just seen a James Bond
      movie or the like.
      It was raining, we were stopped at a red light when Matt told me
      of his intention to marry Jen.
      I was speechless.
      Gobsmaked.
      The cat had got my tongue.
      Those who know me can assure the rest that this is a strange and
      unusual event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt looked at me, and I muttered something about how wonderful
      and great it all was, but nothing could hide my inner turmoil.
      My world had been tipped upside down.
      This is <em>not</em> how reasonable people behave.
      You find a girl you like, move in, and happily live in sin
      for a good three to... thirty years.
      You get a cat, and a dog, and a mortgage.
      Maybe there is confusion about weather the punch
      at the New Year's Eve party has grapefruit in it, and you have a
      kid together.
      Then, <strong>then</strong> you think about getting
      married.
      This  idea of Matt's seemed foolish, foolhardy, and
      premature.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Matt sensibly did propose, and Jen&#8230;accepted.
      They moved in together, with a cat, and while they did not have
      a mortgage they did have a big-arse student loan to share.
      I had a good laugh the other day when I recalled all this
      because, quite frankly,  I find it inconceivable that they would
      not be together forever.
      So I guess this is an apology for that day, Matt.
      Yes, you should marry Jen, because you make each other better
      people.
      You two are perfect match, and I think I have fulfilled my
      clich√© quota for this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so a toast.  To those who could not make it here today:
      especially Matt's family in England, and Jen's Belgium family.
      To Absent Friends and Family.
