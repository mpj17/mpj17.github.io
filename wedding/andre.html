    <h1>Andre's Wedding Speech</h1>
    <p>
      Somewhere in this world there exists a photo of André wearing
      nothing but a red g-string. This raises four questions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Firstly, <i>why</i> was André wearing a red
        g-string?
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, <i>what</i> made André pose for the
        photograph?
      </li>
      <li>
        Third, <i>how</i> did this photo survive all this
        time, without <q>accidentally</q> being damaged?
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, under what circumstances did André think that it
        was a good idea to tell others about the existence of this
        photo, and then ask one of these people to be his Best
        Man?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The answer to the first two questions is easy: love;
      nothing else can make a man do such stupid things, such as
      posing for a photo wearing only a red g-string.  The photo
      survived until now because of trust; Patti will never hand
      over the photo despite how much the Best Man begs, whines,
      or pleads.  Finally, André divulged this information
      because he is honest and open &#8213; and he was a little
      drunk at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a toast, to Patti and André and their love, trust and
      honesty&#8230;
